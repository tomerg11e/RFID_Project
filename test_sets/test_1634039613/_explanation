figuring if the patient zone antenna need to be above the crucial part or a little bit to the side
mabye the rssi and phase will differ greatly in one and not in the other?
seems like there is no real difference

the antenna was right above the patient head
location 1 - above the storage cart
location 2 - standing still in my hand next to the patient
location 3 - "active" next to the patient's upper body
location 4 - "active" next to the patient's lower body
